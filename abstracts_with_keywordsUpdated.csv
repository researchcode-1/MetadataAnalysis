A comprehensive experimental and kinetic modeling study of 1- and 2-pentene,"Dong, S.| Zhang, K.| Ninnemann, E.M.| Najjar, A.| Kukkadapu, G.| Baker, J.| Arafin, F.| Wang, Z.| Pitz, W.J.| Vasu, S.S.| Sarathy, S.M.| Senecal, P.K.| Curran, H.J.","- and -pentene are components in gasoline also used as representative alkene surrogate fuels. Most of the available ignition delay time data literature for these fuels limited to low pressures, high temperatures highly diluted conditions, which limits kinetic model development validation potential Therefore, measurements under engine-like conditions needed provide target understand their low-temperature fuel chemistry extend chemical lower higher pressures. In this study, both a high-pressure shock tube rapid compression machine have been employed measure times over wide temperature range K at equivalence ratios ., . . 'air', pressures atm. At high-temperatures K, experimental show that reactivities very similar all However, temperatures, -pentene shows negative coefficient behavior reactivity compared -pentene. Moreover, carbon monoxide time-histories were measured stoichiometric mixture atm temperatures. Furthermore, species versus profiles jet-stirred reactor K. All validate current mechanism. Starting from published pentane mechanism, modifications made sub-mechanisms resulting overall good predictions. flux sensitivity analyses performed highlight important reactions involved oxidation process.",2021,Chemical Kinetics Characteristics; Ignition Delay; Shock Tubes,Ethylene; Methane; Shock Tubes,Scientific,temperature fuel; fuel chemistry; components gasoline; pressures study; fuels limited
